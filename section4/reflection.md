## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

I was basically using the Pomodoro technique without know a name for it. The main difference was that I was doing 50min blocks with 5min breaks. Then doing around 5 blocks before a longer break. I was also not timing the longer breaks. I was just doing a something else that took 30-1hr.(Run, make/eat dinner, choirs of some kind.)   

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

I was surprised that my time estimate was very close overall. Each exercise varied slightly form what I thought. I was able to stay focused and timing the breaks. Helped me continue to be in the "flow of things".   

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

Objects represent a thing that can have different characteristic. Those can characteristics can be assigned values to describe it.
Array are used for a collections/lists of data.   

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class (Array- Its a list of only one type of data.)
  * List of states and their capitals (Array- Its a list with two things.)
  * List of things to pack for vacation (Array- Also just a list of items.)
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow (Array- List of names for accounts.)
  * List of student names and their cohort(Array- list of names and cohort numbers.)
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake. (Object- Make a cake class with each ingredient is a characteristic of cake. This may be useful in the future to create methods for backing cake.)
  * All my favorite restaurants. (Array- list of restaurants.)


1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

An item on Amazon's website comes to mind. It would have keys's like price, itemNumber, ItemInfo, inStock and shipping time.

class AmazonItem {
  this.price = "$12.93",
  this.itemNumber = 343411,
  this.itemInfo = "This is a Item",
  this.inStock = true,
  this.leadTime = 14,
}  

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?

 When thinking about the object arrays question. I feel that the context of what we are doing with the data, would greatly change how we want to store it. For example if all we are ever going to do with state is link name and capital then array work well. But if we are in the future add data like populationAdd and populationSub and then want it to figure populationGrowth a state class/object might be better. Am I just overthinking this?
