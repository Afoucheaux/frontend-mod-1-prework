## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

1- Reflect and recognize your ability/struggle and then act on those self reflections.
2- You can have both a fixed and growth mindset in different areas of your life.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I am able to do self-reflection and take feedback well. I do struggle sometimes focusing to much on reflecting and need to plan/learn and move forward sooner.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

Google search. It probably take my input and then creates an array of data so that it can manipulate each keyword.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
A way of manipulating the data that is in the array.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

To run the same thing multiple time without have to write it more than once or until a condition is meet. With array- When we want to check for something or conditions to be meet over a data set. Without- When we want something to run a number of time or until a condition is meet.  

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

A loop lets you do something until you get the outcome you want.
e.x. Like bounce a ball off the wall until you miss catching it.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

Was a exciting section. Really enjoyed the last part of loops-arrays. Can start to see the parts coming together.
