## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I am good about asking questions. I do have trouble finding a middle ground on timing. I sometimes feel that I ask too quickly. Or get stubborn with myself and try to figure it out for too long. One of the people in my front-end small group recommended setting a timer and I am going to start trying that out.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

I feel it went pretty well. I could not remember how to run a file in node, I was able to use a keyboard short cut. To quickly look it up in the section1 file. The if-statement, comparison and function portions went well for me. Was able to find the info quickly with the resources given. I think it helped having to look things up on my own. It help in two way. 1- Giving me more confidence in my ability to find answers. 2- Ingrain the things that we have done before like node.  

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
It is a decision tree for the computer to follow. Am I clean? yes- Go to work. no- Take a shower. Amazon Input your credit card. yes- proceed to checkout. no- credit card info (again).

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
else if (). The program starts with the first one, then work through to the last one. Checking if the statement is true. If the statement is true the program stops checking and returns the code in that section.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
Logical Operators ( && and || ).

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
None at this time.
