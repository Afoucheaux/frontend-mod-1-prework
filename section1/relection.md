## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

I have been out of school for some time and it was a good refresher. I feel I view learning as a continuous process and keep a growth mindset. I also enjoy teaching and mentoring people. I would like to start reading more for personal improvement. Especially in more technical fields. Also remembering to take consistent breaks could help me. I tend to just put my head down and grind away at stuff.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

String- Anything that I would like to write or show.
integer- Any whole number.
float- Any number with a decimal in it.
boolean- Data with only two possible states. true/false or yes/no.


3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

console.log("Hello World");

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

// These character let me make comments.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable is an object that you can to assign characteristics to.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Combining variables together.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?

Any website that takes multiple inputs from a user and returns one query. Like Redfin, it takes area, price range, type of home from the user. Then combines that information and returns one list base on the combined result.  

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

Was able to finish the terminal challenges, but feel I do not have the best grasp of the touch command. At this time I have only finish mod0 session 1. There was a note that we will be going over terminal and command line is session 2 and will ask about it there if still unclear.
