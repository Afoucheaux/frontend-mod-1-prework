High level cipher


part1-
Matching "string" letters to their "alphabet array" position. This is done by looping
each letter of the "string" thought the alphabet array.

part2-
Save the string's alphabet array position to a new variable.

part3-
Create "new var" a method in the function that modifies the new string array position. This takes the "converted" and adds the "key value" then returns the new position on the "Key array."

part4- Log the new "String".

part5- To return to the original "string". I would do all the steps again but reverse the
modified steps.


This was my high level starting plan. As I was working my way thought trying to code I found I was missing some steps. I have included more notes. On things I have tried/went wrong in the JavaScrips file. This may not be the most efficient way of doing making the cipher. But it should work with any "string" length and any "key" integer value. We could also use the same code to add numbers/punctuation. By putting them in the alphabet array.
